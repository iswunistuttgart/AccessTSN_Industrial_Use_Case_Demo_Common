# AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo - Common
This is a demonstration to give an example on how to use Linux with the current support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) as an industrial endpoint. For this purpose the components of this demonstration form a converged network use case in an industrial setting. 

The Use Case Demonstration is aimed at the AccessTSN Endpoint Image and tested with it but should also work independently from the image.

This work is a result of the AccessTSN-Project. More information on the project as well as contact information are on the project's webpage: https://accesstsn.com
